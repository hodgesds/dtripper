# Dtripper
golang HTTP over DNS

This project was inspired by a [fun idea](https://github.com/hodgesds/ztripper) I had awhile go and I wanted to expand upon it.

# Example
Running the DNS server:
```sh
   go run server/server.go
```

Run the example http client:
```sh
   go run example/example.go
```
